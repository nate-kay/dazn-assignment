In addition to coordinating projects from start to finish, they may also have responsibilities related to overseeing testing and quality assurance tasks for their teams. A technical lead may also help coordinate tasks between various departments on a project.

\# Principles of technical leadership

Here are some common principles of technical leadership, with a description of each:

\## Using effective communication

The technical lead often communicates with team members through multiple means on a daily basis. This includes verbal communication and written communication, such as email or project documentation. The technical lead often has the responsibility of keeping all relevant parties, including senior management, informed of the progress of a project regularly. Communication channels may include one-on-one meetings, conference calls, instant messaging or office-wide meetings.

\## Having accountability

The technical lead is responsible for the successful delivery of their projects. Technical leads often inspire their team’s commitment to a project, encouraging them to focus on their tasks and complete them on time. A technical lead may work with their team members to determine the scope and goals of their project and are responsible for ensuring that these goals are met.

\## Conducting team building

This principle relates to the ability of the technical lead to build trust, expertise and camaraderie within their team. A great technical lead actively builds relationships with the people they work with, knows their strengths and weaknesses, takes an interest in their personal development and treats them in a friendly, respectful manner. For example, a technical lead may communicate often with each member of the team about their tasks, review progress regularly and provide timely feedback when necessary. They may also ensure that team members effectively communicate with one another as well while completing tasks on projects.

\## Applying technical knowledge

A technical lead often has in-depth knowledge of their team’s specific tasks and the skills that are required to complete them. This often includes knowledge of the technologies they use, the frameworks they follow and the tools they employ when working with a particular technology. The technical lead also often has a basic understanding of company policies, procedures and internal standards related to project management and software architecture.

\# How to become a technical lead

Here is a list of steps you can take to become a technical lead:

\## 1. Complete a technical degree

You may consider pursuing a degree in software engineering, computer science, computer engineering or other related disciplines. These programmes can help build your knowledge of the technologies and processes involved in technical projects. Such degrees often have curriculums that include courses such as computer programming and advanced math.

\## 2. Gain experience managing projects

You can gain valuable experience by being a project team member or project coordinator on a few technology-based projects. While you can sometimes get involved at the management level on smaller projects, being involved in large projects may allow you to learn from a team of experienced project managers. For example, you may work as an assistant project manager on a large-scale engineering project directly assisting more senior project managers.

\## 3. Gain experience in programming and other technical areas

This includes gaining experience with technologies such as C++, Java, .NET and other web-based technologies. If your degree doesn’t cover this type of programming, consider completing a Web development course or studying these technologies independently. This may allow you to provide insight and contribute to technical projects that involve some amount of computer programming.

\## 4. Take training courses

There are many technical leadership training programmes available online and in-person that can be helpful in building your knowledge and skills in this area. These include courses from large software companies and educational institutions. These courses may provide you with leadership, communication, project management and presentation skills that you can use on future technical projects.

\## 5. Become familiar with relevant IT standards and policies

Some companies have internal IT standards and policies that you may follow when conducting technology-based projects. These may include policies relating to what quality assurance tests to conduct and what software to use for particular tasks. For example, many companies require that teams test projects using external software.

\## 6. Build your technical team

This can involve hiring new professionals for your team and providing training and mentoring to existing team members. This may involve working with them to establish their skills in certain areas or develop their knowledge of the latest technologies. For example, you may hold a seminar to help your team develop their presentation skills for team meetings.
